## Usage

Crisp is designed to be user-friendly. Here‚Äôs a simple example of how to set up communication between two AI agents:

```python
from crisp import Agent

# Create two agents
agent1 = Agent("Agent1")
agent2 = Agent("Agent2")

# Establish connection
agent1.connect(agent2)

# Send a message
agent1.send("Hello, Agent2!")
response = agent2.receive()
print(response)  # Output: Hello, Agent2!
```

This basic example demonstrates how agents can communicate effortlessly using Crisp. You can expand on this by implementing more complex interactions and functionalities.
