# Crisp SKC Protocol Implementation

![Crisp Protocol Diagram](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Crisp+Protocol+Architecture)  
*A high-performance implementation of the Cognitive Routing and Information Shaping Protocol*

## üåü Introduction

This repository contains a production-grade implementation of the Crisp Protocol - a revolutionary approach to decentralized knowledge networks based on mathematical addressing and cognitive packet routing. The implementation includes:

- Shared Knowledge Core (SKC) management
- Cognitive packet creation and processing
- Internet Computer (ICP) integration
- VetKey forward-secure authentication
- BF16 vector optimizations for AI workloads

```python
# Create and process a cognitive packet
from crisp_skc import create_cognitive_packet, MessageType, SKCManager

packet = create_cognitive_packet(
    dest="prime_factor_service",
    msg_type=MessageType.QUERY,
    sender="user:123",
    payload={"number": 987654321}
)

skc = SKCManager(node_id="node:alpha")
await skc.process_packet(packet)
```

        sender="user:456",
        payload={"image_id": "camera_789"},
        compute_class="GPU:High"
    )
    
    # Process packet
    await skc.process_packet(packet)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## üìö Documentation

### Creating Cognitive Packets
```python
from crisp_skc import create_cognitive_packet, MessageType, MessageGroup

packet = create_cognitive_packet(
    dest="service:image_processor",
    msg_type=MessageType.QUERY,
    sender="device:camera_5",
    group=MessageGroup.IOT_SENSORS,
    payload={"resolution": "4k", "format": "jpg"},
    ttl=30,
    priority=7
)
```

### Managing SKC Resources
```python
from crisp_skc import create_skc_resource, ResourceType, ComputeClass

resource = create_skc_resource(
    resource_id="res:image_processor_v3",
    full_address="node:gpu_cluster_5",
    resource_type=ResourceType.WASM,
    binary_data=wasm_module,
    compute_class=ComputeClass.GPU_HIGH,
    tags={"image_processing", "ai", "gpu_optimized"}
)

await skc.register_resource(resource)
```

### Using VetKey Security
```python
# Sign packet before sending
packet.sign_with_vetkey(skc.vet_key)

# Verify incoming packets
if packet.verify_vet_signature():
    print("Valid signature!")
```

### BF16 Vector Operations
```python
from crisp_skc import BF16Vector

# Create optimized vectors
vector1 = BF16Vector([0.12, 0.34, 0.56, ...])
vector2 = BF16Vector([0.23, 0.45, 0.67, ...])

# Calculate similarity
similarity = vector1.cosine_similarity(vector2)
print(f"Cosine similarity: {similarity:.4f}")
```
