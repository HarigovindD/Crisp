# Crisp SKC Library

The Crisp Shared Knowledge Core (SKC) Library is a high-performance Python implementation of an AI-native knowledge repository and communication system, as defined in the Crisp Protocol Specification v1.2 (June 13, 2025). It enables hyper-efficient, semantically precise exchanges between AI agents using optimized Cognitive Packets (CPs) and a decentralized knowledge core.

## Features
- **Optimized Cognitive Packets**: MessagePack, binary format, and caching for minimal overhead.
- **High-Performance SKC**: In-memory storage with indexed searches, async processing, and query caching.
- **AI-Native Design**: Built for machine-to-machine communication with semantic precision.
- **Security & Audit**: Supports cryptographic signatures and audit trails.
- **Extensibility**: Supports WASM execution and dynamic resource types.

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
